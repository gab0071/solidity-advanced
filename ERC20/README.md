<p>In this project we went to a more advanced level, making an ERC20 Token interface, and doing our import to create a Token in minutes.</p>

<p>We create our tests and test each function created in smart contracts, passing them all successfully.</p>

<p>I hope you are encouraged to do this project, it was a lot of fun and the knowledge you will acquire will help you in the future to develop your projects as a professional.</p>

<h2>Prettier definition </h2>
<p> Prettier offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What <Prettier> offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.</p>
